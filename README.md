# Steam Trade Offer Manager for node.js/io.js **BETA**

This module is designed to be a completely self-contained manager for [Steam trade offers](https://steamcommunity.com/my/tradeoffers).

Instead of being just a simple API wrapper, it's designed to take most of the work out of implementing trade offers in your application.

Install it from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/steam-tradeoffer-manager) or check out the [wiki](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/node-steam-tradeoffer-manager/wiki) for documentation.
